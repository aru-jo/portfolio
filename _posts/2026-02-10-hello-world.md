This is the first post on my blog. I have been meaning to write more, so here we are.

I built this blog with Jekyll on GitHub Pages -- minimal setup, no heavy themes, just Markdown files that become HTML. The design matches the rest of my site: one custom font, ~75 lines of CSS, and nothing else.

More posts to come on software engineering, distributed systems, and whatever else I find interesting.
