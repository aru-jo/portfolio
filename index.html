<p class="highlight"><strong>I am currently open to new opportunities.</strong> If you're looking for a software engineer with experience in distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, let's talk. Here's my <a href="/uploads/AJ_resume_2026.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

<p>I'm Aravind, a software development engineer based in Redmond, WA. I am currently at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, where I have spent the last five and a half years building backend services at scale.</p>

<p>Most recently, I worked on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html">RDS Data API</a> &mdash; a secure HTTP endpoint that lets applications run SQL statements on Aurora databases without managing connections or network configuration. Before that, I was on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/">AWS IoT Greengrass</a> team, building the edge runtime and cloud service for deploying and managing device software.</p>

<p>I hold an MS in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California">USC Viterbi</a> and a B.Tech in Information Technology from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Institute_of_Technology">Madras Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

<p>My interests are in software engineering at scale, distributed systems, and backend infrastructure. I enjoy working on problems where reliability, performance, and simplicity all matter.</p>
